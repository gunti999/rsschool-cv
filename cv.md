##### Multiples of 3 or 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

**Note:** If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

```
function solution(number){
  let num = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
    if (i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0) {
      num += i;
    }  
  }
  return num;
}
